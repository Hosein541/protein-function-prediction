Sequences longer than this are truncated, and shorter sequences are \"padded\" with a special token (0) until they reach this length."

        "This project successfully demonstrated an end-to-end workflow for predicting protein function from amino acid sequences using deep learning. We developed, trained, and rigorously compared two distinct models: a baseline 1D-CNN and a fine-tuned ESM-2 Transformer.\n",
        "\n",
        "After optimizing the decision threshold for both models, our final results showed that the **1D-CNN baseline model slightly outperformed the pre-trained ESM-2 Transformer** on both primary metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key takeaway is a crucial lesson in applied machine learning: a well-designed, simpler architecture can be more effective than a large, complex pre-trained model, especially on specific, moderately-sized datasets. This result underscores the importance of **always establishing a strong baseline** and highlights that the most advanced model is not always the best solution for every problem."
